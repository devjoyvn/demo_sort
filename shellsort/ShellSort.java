/*
 *
 * ShellSort is mainly a variation of Insertion Sort. In insertion sort,
 * we move elements only one position ahead. When an element has to be moved
 * far ahead, many movements are involved. The idea of shellSort is to allow
 * exchange of far items. In shellSort, we make the array h-sorted for a large
 * value of h. We keep reducing the value of h until it becomes 1. An array
 * is said to be h-sorted if all sublists of every hâ€™th element is sorted.
 * O(n^2)
